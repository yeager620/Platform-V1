# [DEPRECATED] Platform-V1
Data Analytics, Backtesting, and Live Theo Odds

This repo is *mostly* garbage and hasnt really been updated since 1/??/25. AFAIK any strategy that can be directly plucked from this repo is either not profitable (due to lookahead bias or the like) or not feasible. That being said there is some great data pipelining infrastructure here.
